# With this script you can run all the virt tools without needing to
# install them first.  You just have to do for example:
#
#   ./run virt-inspector [args ...]
#
# This works for any C program, virt tools, and most non-C bindings
# and programs in the libguestfs distribution.
#
# For lots more ways to use this script, see the libguestfs
# guestfs-building(1) man page.
#
# The script should also be used for tests like this:
#
#   TESTS_ENVIRONMENT = ... $(top_builddir)/run --test
#
# The --test parameter introduces a timeout, stopping tests from
# running forever.
