    The format for RHV export storage domain is described in:

    The format understood by oVirt has no known documentation.

    OVF isn't a real standard, so it's likely that if we ever had to
    create OVF for another target management system then we would need
    to heavily modify or even duplicate this code. *)

    Note this does not write them, since output_rhv has to do a

    [target_file ^ ".meta"]. *)
