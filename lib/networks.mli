(** Network, bridge and MAC address mapping. *)

type t                          (** The map. *)

val create : unit -> t
(** Create an empty mapping. *)

val add_network : t -> string -> string -> unit
(** Add a network mapping from C<in> to C<out>.

    Equivalent to the [--network in:out] option. *)

val add_default_network : t -> string -> unit
(** Add a default network mapping.

    Equivalent to the [--network out] option. *)

val add_bridge : t -> string -> string -> unit
(** Add a bridge mapping from C<in> to C<out>.

    Equivalent to the [--bridge in:out] option. *)

val add_default_bridge : t -> string -> unit
(** Add a default bridge mapping.

    Equivalent to the [--bridge out] option. *)

val add_mac : t -> string -> Types.vnet_type -> string -> unit
(** Add a MAC address mapping.

    Equivalent to the [-mac MAC:<network|bridge>:out] option. *)

val map : t -> Types.source_nic -> Types.source_nic
(** Apply the mapping to the source NIC, returning the updated
    NIC with possibly modified [s_vnet] and [s_vnet_type] fields.

    MAC address mappings take precedence, followed by network
    and bridge mappings if no MAC address mapping for the NIC can
    be found. *)
