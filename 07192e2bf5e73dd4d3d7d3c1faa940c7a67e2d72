The original intent of this timeout command was to wait for Windows
Update to settle down before testing for the registry entries that
show that Windows has to be rebooted (this is obviously inherently
racy).

However it caused a regression.  If Windows sets the timezone while
the timeout command is running (in one case, setting the wallclock
time back by 2 hours), then the timeout command will wait for 2 hours
+ 10 seconds.  Unbelievable, but true.

Alternatives were considered:

 - Using a 'ping 127.0.0.1' command, which is effectively a 5 second
   delay.  We worried this might cause issues on IPv6-only stacks.

 - Using a Powershell command, although that might have the same
   problem.

For now, remove the timeout and carry out more testing.
