To-do list for virt-v2v
======================================================================

We open the input NBD endpoint up to 5 times per disk during a
conversion (especially if --verbose mode is used):

 * Once for conversion

 * nbdinfo opens the connection twice (because we're using --content)

 * The output side opens the input connection just to get the virtual
   size of the disk, so it knows how large to create the output disk.
   (Could be avoided if conversion kept this information, but that's a
   layering violation.)

 * once for nbdcopy

This has quite a lot of overhead for some inputs.  For VDDK, opening a
connection is very slow.  In one conversion of a guest with 5 disks I
measured 10% of the total run time of virt-v2v being spent simply
opening VDDK connections (5 x 5 = 25 times in all).

In virt-v2v -o openstack Use the metadata service to find the -oo
server-id setting.  It would no longer need to be specified on the
command line.  Note there are two variations of metadata service in
OpenStack, either the config disk or link-local network address.  We
would need to support both, or the possibility that there is no
metadata service.
