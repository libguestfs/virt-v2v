(** Convert metadata to a list of OpenStack image properties.

    These properties are suitable for use by Glance or Cinder.
    Note for Cinder there is a difference between properties and
    image properties (this module implements the latter). *)

val create : Types.source -> Types.inspect -> Types.target_meta ->
             (string * string) list
(** [create source target_buses guestcaps inspect target_firmware]
    translates the metadata into a list of image properties suitable
    for OpenStack.

    The returned list is a set of key=value pairs which can be passed
    to Glance (using [--property key=value]) or to Cinder.  For
    Cinder note that you must not use [--property] since that sets
    volume properties which are different from image properties.
    Instead use [openstack volume set --image-property key=value ...]. *)
