Specify the name or UUID of the conversion appliance using

  virt-v2v ... -o openstack -oo server-id=<NAME|UUID>

When virt-v2v runs it will attach the Cinder volumes to the
conversion appliance, so this name or UUID must be the name
of the virtual machine on OpenStack where virt-v2v is running.

In addition, all usual OpenStack “os-*” parameters or “OS_*”
environment variables can be used.

Openstack “--os-*” parameters must be written as “virt-v2v -oo os-*”.

For example:

  virt-v2v -oo os-username=<NAME>

                equivalent to openstack: --os-username=<NAME>
            or the environment variable: OS_USERNAME=<NAME>

  virt-v2v -oo os-project-name=<NAME>

                equivalent to openstack: --os-project-name=<NAME>
            or the environment variable: OS_PROJECT_NAME=<NAME>

The os-* parameters and environment variables are optional.
