type t

val create : unit -> t
(** Create an empty qemu command line.

    In case of error, all these functions raise [Unix_error]. *)

val set_binary : t -> string -> unit
(** Set the qemu binary name. *)

val set_binary_by_arch : t -> string option -> unit
(** Set the qemu binary to [qemu-system-<arch>].  If [arch] is [None],
    then this picks the right KVM binary for the current host
    architecture. *)

val flag : t -> string -> unit
(** [flag t "-foo"] adds a parameter to the command line with no argument. *)

val arg : t -> string -> string -> unit
(** [arg t "-m" "1024"] adds [-m 1024] to the command line.

    The value will shell-quoted if required, so you do not need to quote
    the string.  However if the value is a comma-separated list
    (eg. [-drive file=foo,if=ide]) then do {b not} use this function, call
    {!arg_list} instead. *)

val arg_noquote : t -> string -> string -> unit
(** Like {!arg} except no quoting is done on the value. *)

val arg_list : t -> string -> string list -> unit
(** [arg_list t "-drive" ["file=foo"; "if=ide"]] adds a comma-separated
    list of parameters to the command line [-drive file=foo,if=ide].

    This does both qemu comma-quoting and shell-quoting as required. *)

val raw : t -> string -> unit
(** [raw "stuff"] adds [stuff] to the command line completely
    unquoted.  Use with care. *)

val to_script : t -> string -> unit
(** [to_script t "./file.sh"] writes the resulting command line to
    a file.  The file begins with [#!/bin/sh] and is chmod 0755. *)

val to_chan : t -> out_channel -> unit
(** [to_chan t chan] appends the resulting command line to
    an output channel.  The caller must write [!#/bin/sh] and chmod 0755
    the output file, if needed. *)
