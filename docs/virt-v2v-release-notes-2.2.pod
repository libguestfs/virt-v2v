=head1 NAME

virt-v2v-release-notes - virt-v2v release notes for 2.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the release notes for S<B<virt-v2v 2.2>>.
This describes the major changes since 2.0.

Virt-v2v 2.2.0 was released on S<B<Tuesday 10 January 2023>>.

=head2 Security

When running virt-v2v as root, NBD Unix domain sockets in the v2v
directory were openable by any user.  We now set the directory owner
so only qemu can access the sockets.  See:
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2066773 (thanks
Xiaodai Wang, S<Dr David Gilbert>, Daniel Berrangé, Laszlo Ersek).

=head2 New features

New L<virt-v2v-inspector(1)> tool.  This tool can be used before
conversion to collect facts about the source guest, such as number of
disks, and to estimate the disk space required after conversion.

Add support for NVMe devices and SATA hard disks when importing from
VMware VMX files (Laszlo Ersek).

Add support for importing to KubeVirt using the new B<experimental>
I<-o kubevirt> mode.

Windows 11 guests are now supported.

Rocky Linux guest support has been added (Andrey Drobyshev).

=head2 Feature removed

The I<-o json> mode was removed.  It was intended to be used with
KubeVirt but was never actually used there.  Use I<-o kubevirt>
instead.

=head2 Other fixes

Fix detection of virtio-socket support in Linux guests (Laszlo Ersek).
In addition, a semi-random guest CID is chosen in I<-o qemu> mode,
avoiding an error.

Allow importing OVAs where the user or group name inside the tarball
contains a space (Jiří Sléžka).

Reject guests with snapshots when using -i vmx -it ssh (Laszlo Ersek).

Improve documentation for the need to enable PasswordAuthentication on
the server side when importing over SSH (Laszlo Ersek).

Don't use the deprecated qemu I<-balloon> option.  This caused
deprecation warnings with I<-o qemu> mode.  Use I<-device> instead.

Rewrite device mapping in I<-o qemu> mode, removing some strange /
non-existent cases like SCSI floppies.  This should result in more
consistent device layout when using this mode (Laszlo Ersek).

Remove more left over open-vm-tools packages from Linux guests (Tim
Kent).

In I<-o rhv-upload> mode, do not return until the VM has been created
(Tomáš Golembiovský).

Greatly improved vCPU model handling (Laszlo Ersek).

Document extra permissions needed for non-admin conversion with
S<VMware 7> (Ming Xie).

QEMU guest agent is now installed unconditionally and where possible a
virtio-serial socket is created in the guest metadata (Laszlo Ersek).

In the various RHV output modes, the number of disks is now limited to
23.  RHV doesn't support anything greater and would break (Laszlo
Ersek).

I<-oo compressed> is now working again.  It was temporarily broken in
virt-v2v 2.0.

The documentation no longer advises you to use the dangerous global
"LEGACY crypto" option, but provides more targeted advice (Laszlo
Ersek).

Remove the LVM2 devices file during conversion (Laszlo Ersek).

Add support for guests using Zstandard compressed kernel modules.

Add the BOCHS DRM display driver in Linux guest initrd, to avoid a
crash with some guests with graphical boot displays (Laszlo Ersek).

The UEFI fallback boot loader is now fixed up if we detect that it was
broken (Laszlo Ersek).

Improve detection of guests using BIOS boot with GPT partitions so
that we no longer confuse them with UEFI guests (Andrey Drobyshev).

Fix conflict between fwcfg and qemufwcfg Windows drivers (Laszlo
Ersek).

Fix Windows 11 support for RHV outputs (Laszlo Ersek).

=head2 Build changes

Enable malloc debugging in tests with glibc E<ge> 2.34.

When using C<make check-valgrind>, valgrind output is no longer
written to separate files under F<tmp/>.  Instead it is written to the
normal test log file.

We now require ocamldep I<-one-line> and I<-all> options (added to
ocamldep in Jan 2012).

The OCaml libvirt bindings are no longer bundled.  They must be
available at build time.

Updated the phony test images.  The tests should all pass.

Add compatibility with OCaml 4.14.

We now require PCRE2 instead of PCRE.

=head2 Internals

New LUKS-on-LVM test added (Laszlo Ersek).

Added F<scripts/git.orderfile> which orders files when we prepare
patches.
