=head1 NAME

virt-v2v-release-notes - virt-v2v release notes for 2.0

=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the release notes for S<B<virt-v2v 2.0>>.
This describes the major changes since 1.42.

No release notes were published for 1.44, so that release is covered
here.

Virt-v2v 2.0.0 was released on S<B<14 March 2022>>.

=head2 Security

There were no security-related bugs found in this release.

=head2 New features

Virt-v2v has been modularised allowing external programs to examine
the state of the conversion and inject their own copying step.
Further enhancements will be made to this new architecture in
forthcoming releases.

The command line is almost identical apart from some debugging
features that were removed (see below).  The only significant
difference is that the output format (I<-of>) now has to be specified
if it is different from the input format, whereas previous versions of
virt-v2v would use the same output format as input format
automatically.

A lot of time was spent improving the performance of virt-v2v in
common cases.

Implement conversion of ALT Linux guests (Mikhail Gordeev).

Many bug fixes and performance enhancements were made to oVirt imageio
output (Nir Soffer).

There is a new L<virt-v2v-in-place(1)> tool which replaces the
existing virt-v2v I<--in-place> option.

Virt-v2v can now convert guests which use LUKS encrypted logical
volumes (Laszlo Ersek).

Option I<-oo rhv-direct> has been replaced by I<-oo rhv-proxy>, and
direct mode (which is much faster) is now the default when writing to
oVirt, with proxy mode available for restricted network configurations
(thanks: Nir Soffer).

The following command line options were removed: I<--print-estimate>,
I<--debug-overlays>, I<--no-copy>.

Virt-v2v no longer installs the RHEV-APT tool in Windows guests.  This
tool was deprecated and then removed in oVirt 4.3.

Deprecated tool virt-v2v-copy-to-local has been removed.  This was
deprecated in November 2018.

=head2 Other fixes

Remove reference to prl_strg driver in Windows guests to avoid BSOD
(Denis Plotnikov).

Fix conversions of UEFI Linux guests that don't provide their own
fallback bootloader (Denis Plotnikov).

Remove use of L<nbdkit-readahead-filter(1)>.  This filter uses a naive
strategy and it had several negative effects on conversions.

Remove prompts for interactive passwords.  Normally you should try to
use the I<-ip> and/or I<-op> options to supply passwords.

For Windows guests, we insert a schtasks command.  However the
parameters of this command are timezone dependent and so it failed in
non-European timezones.  (Thanks: Dinesh Herath, Tomáš Golembiovský,
Bryan Kinney, Mark Zealey, Xiaodai Wang)

Virt-v2v will reauthenticate with vCenter servers periodically when
copying guests over HTTPS which stops large guests and/or slow copies
taking longer than about 30 minutes from failing.

Virt-v2v now sets libguestfs SMP to match number of physical host
CPUs, which helps performance of certain conversion steps.

Virt-v2v output to oVirt now attempts to set the machine and firmware
type correctly.  Note an exact mapping is not always possible and
oVirt may ignore our recommendations (incorrectly) sometimes.

Virt-v2v now generates a virtio-vsock device for guests which support
it (Valeriy Vdovin).

All guests now need at least 100 MB of free space for conversion to
succeed (Ming Xie).

Standard VGA instead of QXL is now used as the video type for
converted guests (Laszlo Ersek).

Older guests (eg RHEL 6) will use the virtio-transitional model after
conversion.  This feature and the machine type are now usually
determined from the libosinfo database, falling back to hard-coded
values if libosinfo is not available (Laszlo Ersek).

When virt-v2v prints messages to a pipe or file it no longer wraps
them, making parsing simpler.  You can enable wrapping in this mode
using I<--wrap> (Laszlo Ersek).

Windows guest firstboot scripts installed by virt-v2v now run in the
right order, making network configuration happen earlier (Laszlo
Ersek).

=head2 Build changes

libguestfs E<ge> 1.44 is now required.

L<nbdcopy(1)> and OCaml NBD bindings, both from libnbd E<ge> 1.10, are
now required.

nbdkit E<ge> 1.22 is now required (Nir Soffer).

pcre2 (instead of pcre) is now required.

gnulib is no longer bundled or used by virt-v2v.

OCaml E<ge> 4.04 is now required.  OCaml 4.13 support has been added
in this release.

OpenSSH scp E<ge> 8.8 is now required.  Earlier versions will fail
because the command line syntax was changed incompatibly.

=head2 Internals

Weblate instead of Zanata is now used for translations (Pino Toscano).
